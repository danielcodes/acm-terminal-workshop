# ACM Terminal Workshop

### CCNY ACM Club - Oct 22, 2015

## About
This repo is meant to support the [CCNY ACM Club's][acm] Terminal Workshop.
The Unix terminal is an efficient tool to get things done, and it is vital to many serious programmers.
The workshop is meant to get beginners, who have little to no prior experience with Unix, up and running fast.

Windows users, who don't have access to a Linux virtual machine, are suggested to use Git Bash as their Unix environment. Git Bash can be [downloaded here][git]. On the otherhand, Linux and OS X will be fine with their native Unix environment.
